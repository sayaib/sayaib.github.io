              <strong>How it Helps:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li className="description_doc">
                  <strong>Faster Development:</strong> Instead of repeatedly
                  writing boilerplate code for common tasks (like setting up a
                  function, class, or API request), you can insert snippets with
                  a simple shortcut. This reduces the time spent on mundane
                  tasks, allowing you to focus on solving real problems.
                </li>
                <li className="description_doc">
                  <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Preloaded snippets give you quick
                  access to commonly used code patterns, eliminating the need to
                  search for them online or look them up in documentation.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="description_doc">
              <strong>Example:</strong>
              If you frequently write functions to handle API calls, you don’t
              need to rewrite the same fetch logic every time. You just insert
              the preloaded Fetch API snippet and move on with your task.

              <strong>How it Helps:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li className="description_doc">
                  <strong>Consistency:</strong> Preloaded snippets are often
                  built following best practices. They are well-tested, clean,
                  and efficient, ensuring that you’re not making common mistakes
                  when implementing certain tasks (like using the correct fetch
                  options or defining the proper error handling).
                </li>
                <li className="description_doc">
                  <strong>Less Room for Human Error:</strong> When developers
                  manually write repetitive code (like setting up error handlers
                  or defining a class structure), they are prone to making
                  mistakes. Preloaded snippets reduce the chances of introducing
                  bugs or misconfigurations.
                </li>
                <li className="description_doc">
                  <strong>Standardized Patterns:</strong> Custom snippets allow
                  you to create your own templates based on your preferred
                  coding standards and patterns, ensuring that your code remains
                  consistent across all your projects.

            <p className="description_doc">
              <strong>Example:</strong>
              If you are using a snippet for error handling in JavaScript (e.g.,
              wrapping a fetch call in a try-catch block), using preloaded or
              custom snippets reduces the risk of forgetting essential parts of
              the code or writing inefficient logic.

                  <strong>Reuse Across Projects:</strong> Custom snippets allow
                  you to define code that you frequently use across multiple
                  projects. This is particularly helpful for common functions,
                  utilities, or even project scaffolding.

                <li className="description_doc">
                  <strong>Centralized Codebase:</strong> Snippets act as a
                  centralized library for your commonly used pieces of code. If
                  you have a particular way of doing things (e.g., setting up a
                  React component, handling user input validation, or
                  interacting with an API), you can create custom snippets for
                  those tasks and reuse them whenever needed.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="description_doc">
              <strong>Example:</strong>
              You can create a custom React component boilerplate snippet, which
              includes necessary imports, state initialization, and a basic
              render function. Whenever you start a new React project, you can
              insert this snippet and get straight to writing the specific logic
              for the component.

                  <strong>Consistency Across Teams:</strong> When working in

                  everyone adheres to the same coding standards and patterns. It
                  makes it easier for new team members to get up to speed, as
                  they don't need to reinvent the wheel for tasks like setting

                  collaboration enhances productivity, as others can benefit
                  from your commonly used code patterns, and you can learn from
